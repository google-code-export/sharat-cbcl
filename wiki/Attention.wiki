=Introduction=
Describes how to install, use and experiment with the Bayesian model of attention

=Getting the code=
You can obtain a read-only version of the code using the following:
{{{
svn checkout http://sharat-cbcl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/attention 
}}}
If you would like to contribute code/bug-fixes as well, please send me an e-mail to obtain read/write access to the repository.

==Dependencies=
 * You will need a working model of a matlab
 * The code relies upon the BNT-toolbox to perform inference. There is a local copy checked in. However, if you need the latest updates go to http://code.google.com/p/bnt/

=Details=
The code is organized as follows (as now only code listed here is supported)

*attention/*
{{{
test_spatial_invariance.m  Demonstrates spatial invariance properties of the model.
test_spatial_attention.m   Demonstrates spatial attention in the model.
test_popout.m              Demonstrates popout using orientation features.
}}}
